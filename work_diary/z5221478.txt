Week 1:
Group formed. I created my Jira and Github accounts. I discussed with my teammates about the project topic we will choose (Myrecipe) and programming languages we will use for this project (SQL for database, Python for backend and flask for frontend). I discussed with team about the attributes our software needs and recorded them. The team agreed to use a cloud disk for file sharing. I made my github run correctly and made some changes to our project master branch. I wrote several user stories and upload to our cloud disk.

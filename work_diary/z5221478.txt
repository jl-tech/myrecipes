Week 1:
Group formed. I created my Jira and Github accounts. I discussed with my teammates about the project topic we will choose (Myrecipe) and programming languages we will use for this project (SQL for database,
Python for backend and flask for frontend). I discussed with team about the attributes our software needs and recorded them.
